# Automation working group

This is part of a broader [quality framework](../README.md) and is one of a set of [communities of practice](../communities-of-practice.md)

## Subject

Automated Testing and Quality Working Group (AWG)

## Sponsor

[andyblundell](https://github.com/andyblundell)

## Goals

The goal is to provide solutions and guidance on Automated Testing and Quality, including:
* Share knowledge
* Provide advice and guidance
* Deliver solutions to relevant issues
* Curate relevant Training Pathways within the [Software Engineering Quality Framework](../README.md)
* Provide supplementary training in relevant areas (e.g. guest speakers, workshops)
* Curate relevant principals, practices and patterns within the [Software Engineering Quality Framework](../README.md)

Goals to be reviewed December 2020

## Scope

Areas of interest are specifically:
* Automated Functional Testing
* Automated Non-Functional Testing, e.g. load/capacity/performance/soak testing, security testing, etc
* Automated Code Hygiene. e.g. static code analysis, dead code detection, code profiling, technical debt, etc

## Coordinator

* This will be a rotating post on a 3-month basis, requiring a commitment of one day per week
* Subject to confirming availability (TODO: confirm), [dlavender4](https://github.com/dlavender4) will be coordinator initially
* The coordinator will run a blog to help publicise the activity of the group

## Format

* The group will have an open backlog (TODO: where). The Sponsor and Coordinator will manage the backlog.
* Tickets will be sized and timeboxed to maximum one month to avoid carry-over.
* The group will meet every month to discuss issues, demonstrate solutions, and agree who will work on new tickets.
* To keep these meetings manageable and useful, the aim is to have one representative from each area (this could be a single person, or a rotating role). The aim is for between 10 to 20 people to attend each session.
* The group will also organise and facilitate other meetings, such as training workshops, hack-days, etc, which will be open to a much wider audience.
* The group will maintain a discussion channel (TODO: where) for advice and guidance, as well as group announcements.
