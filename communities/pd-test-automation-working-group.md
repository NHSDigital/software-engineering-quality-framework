# Test Automation Working Group

This is part of a broader [quality framework](../README.md) and is one of a set of [communities of practice](communities-of-practice.md)

## Subject

Covers Test Automation and Quality Checking tools and approaches within NHS Digital Product Development.

## Sponsor

Andy Blundell [andyblundell](https://github.com/andyblundell)

## Goals

The goal is to provide solutions and guidance on Automated Testing and Quality, including:

* Share knowledge
* Provide advice and guidance
* Deliver solutions to relevant issues
* Curate relevant Training Pathways within the [Software Engineering Quality Framework](../README.md)
* Provide supplementary training in relevant areas (e.g. guest speakers, workshops)
* Curate relevant principals, practices and patterns within the [Software Engineering Quality Framework](../README.md)

Goals to be reviewed December 2020

## Scope

Areas of interest are specifically:

* Automated Functional Testing
* Automated Non-Functional Testing, e.g. load/capacity/performance/soak testing, security testing, etc
* Automated Code Hygiene. e.g. static code analysis, dead code detection, code profiling, technical debt, etc

## Coordinator

* This will be a rotating post on a 3-month basis, requiring a commitment of one day per week
* The coordinator will run a blog to help publicise the activity of the group
* There will be a deputy coordinator (to cover sessions when the coordinator is away, etc). They will also typically take over as coordinator for the following 3 months. This gives the group continuity.
* David Lavender [dlavender4](https://github.com/dlavender4) will be coordinator initially
* A Deputy will be found during the first sessions

## Members

* Formed from within PD
* Core members should be kept to under 15, to promote interactive sessions
* Should include a mix of backgrounds including Dev, DevOps, Test and Assurance.
* Should include people from a representative spread of teams
* Can join as representatives from a specific team, or as "interested parties"

## Format

* The group's official home is the "Test Automation CoP" Teams channel
* This includes a Backlog and Wiki
* Any member can contribute to the backlog. This could be show-and-tells of tools or approaches; queries about how to do something; curation of a principle; talking about an organisation-wide policy; etc.
* The group meet regularly to refine the backlog, and talk through items
* The group will also organise and facilitate other meetings, such as training workshops, hack-days, etc, which will be open to a much wider audience.
* The group will maintain a discussion channel ("Test Automation") open to all of PD: for advice and guidance, and wider knowledge sharing
