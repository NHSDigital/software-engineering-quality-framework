* (TBC - any more?)

## Coordinator

* The group will also organise and facilitate other meetings, such as training workshops, hack-days, etc, which will be open to a much wider audience.
* The group will maintain a discussion channel (TBC - where) open to all of NHS Digital: for advice and guidance, and wider knowledge sharing
