# Secure Engineering CoP (Community of Practice)

This is part of a broader [quality framework](../README.md) and is one of a set of [communities of practice](../communities-of-practice.md)

## Subject

Secure Engineering practices, tools & approaches within NHS Digital.

## Sponsor

(TBC who)

## Goals

For secure development and operation of systems:

* **Share** knowledge:
  * Provide advice and guidance as requested
  * Facilitate good practice discussions, and curate relevant principles, practices and patterns within the [Software Engineering Quality Framework](../README.md)
  * Curate relevant Training Pathways within the [Software Engineering Quality Framework](../README.md)
  * Curate relevant section(s) within the [Software Engineering Review Tool](../review.md)
  * Provide supplementary learning in relevant areas (e.g. workshops)
  * Discuss, disseminate and feedback on the output of the Cyber Design Authority
* **Build** knowledge:
  * Organise learning events (e.g. guest speakers)
  * Organise events to practice security (e.g. security jams)
  * Evaluate candidate security tools
  * Form mini-groups to respond to "how do I..." questions from teams - generating examples in the [Software Engineering Quality Framework](../README.md)

Goals to be reviewed after 3 months

## Scope

Areas of interest are specifically:

* Secure development & operations practices
* Security good practice
* Automated security-testing tools, for example tools to scan for secrets or other sensitive data

## Coordinator

* Initially:
  * There will be a faciliator group, comprising of a representative from each of the member NHS Digital directorates (DSC, Product Development, Platforms, Security Architecture)
  * The group will self-organise who faciliates individual sessions & activities
* Once the community is established:
  * This will be a rotating post on a 3-month basis, requiring a commitment of one day per week
  * The coordinator will run a blog to help publicise the activity of the group
  * There will be a deputy coordinator (to cover sessions when the coordinator is away, etc). They will also typically take over as coordinator for the following 3 months. This gives the group continuity.

## Members

* This group will span NHS Digital and include representatives from DSC, SSS, and delivery teams
* If possible, this group will also include external (to NHS Digital) subject-matter experts
* Core members should be kept to under 15, to promote interactive sessions
* Should include a mix of backgrounds including members of the Data Security Centre and team members with no Security qualifications
* Should include people from a representative spread of teams / directorates
* Can join as representatives from a specific team, or as "interested parties"

## Format

* The group's official home is (TBC - where)
* This includes a Backlog
* Any member can contribute to the backlog. This could be show-and-tells of tools or approaches; queries about how to do something; curation of a principle; talking about an organisation-wide policy; etc.
* The group meet regularly (TBC - how frequently) to refine the backlog, and talk through items
* The group will also organise and facilitate other meetings, such as training workshops, hack-days, etc, which will be open to a much wider audience.
* The group will maintain a discussion channel (TBC - where) open to all of NHS Digital: for advice and guidance, and wider knowledge sharing
