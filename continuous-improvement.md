# Continuous improvement

Continuous improvement is the practice of iteratively reviewing processes and impediments and making incremental changes to reduce waste and increase quality.

## The PDCA cycle

A common pattern is the PDCA cycle attributed to Demming and Shewhart, and here adapted from  [ASQ](https://asq.org/quality-resources/continuous-improvement):
*	**Plan**: Identify an opportunity and plan for change.
*	**Do**: Implement the change on a small scale.
*	**Check**: Use data to analyse the results of the change and determine whether it made a difference.
*	**Act**: If the change was successful, reinforce it or implement it on a wider scale and continuously assess your results. If the change did not work, begin the cycle again &mdash; i.e. try a different approach to driving improvement in this area.

At any one time, you may have several improvement initiatives in progress.

## Identifying improvement opportunities

Regular team retrospectives are an effective way to identify improvement opportunities and actions. In high level terms the opportunities for reducing waste or improving quality tend to be in one of two areas:

### 1. Process or practice

The [Lean principles](principles.md) give some useful areas to consider. Some examples may be the way stories are analysed or elaborated, the way code is written or reviewed, the tools and techniques for testing, communication and collaboration mechanisms within and between teams and team structures.

### 2. Technical debt

Technical debt arises due to processes or practices in the past, but is having an ongoing impact on the present. Examples include code which needs to be refactored, technologies which should be replaced or areas with insufficient, inefficient or ineffective testing.
