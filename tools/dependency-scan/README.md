# Dependency Scan

## Problem

The dependency scan feature can automatically find security vulnerabilities in your dependencies while you are developing and testing your applications. For example, dependency scanning lets you know if your application uses an external (open source) library that is known to be vulnerable. You can then take action to protect your application.

## Solution

TODO: Recipe 1a: Docker images as targets

- [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft)
- [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)

TODO: Recipe 1b: Filesystem / repository

TODO: Recipe 2: Using Docker images, Makefile and shell scripting

TODO: Recipe 3: Using GitHub workflow action

## How It Works

TODO: more details on how syft and grype work

- SBOM standards [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) and [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)
