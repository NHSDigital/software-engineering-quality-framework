# Software Engineering Quality Framework

## How to get started

See the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)

## Purpose

This framework is concerned with using "good" software engineering to support rapid and safe delivery of high-quality software, at scale

It aims to:

1. Describe a shared (across multiple teams) definition of "good" engineering
2. Provide tools for teams to gain insight into their current engineering maturity levels and their level of [technical debt](tech-debt.md)
3. Provide resources to support teams to increase their engineering maturity levels and manage their [technical debt](tech-debt.md)

## Philosophy

The philosophy underpinning this framework advocates:

* Engineering led by user needs and service outcomes
* Empowered delivery teams which are accountable for their products
* Products must be actively maintained for their entire lifecycle
* Rapid, iterative and incremental development: "Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers." (Eric S. Raymond in [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar))
* Robust and comprehensive automation supporting and enforcing quality
* Reliable & scalable services, remembering "Everything fails, all the time" (Werner Vogels), and treating operations as a software engineering challenge (as in Google's [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/))
* Loosely-coupled & cloud-native composable components as the default mode of construction
* Continuous improvement, with prioritisation decisions based on data rather than sentiment

## Context

The framework is a companion to:

* The [NHS service standard](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard), with cross-references in this format: [SERVICE-RELIABILITY](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard/14-operate-a-reliable-service)
* The [NHS Digital architectural principles](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/nhs-digital-architecture/principles), with cross-references in this format: [ARCHITECTURE-SECURITY](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/nhs-digital-architecture/principles/adopt-appropriate-cyber-security-standards)

## Contents

The framework consists of:
