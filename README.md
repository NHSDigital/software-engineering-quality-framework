# Software Engineering Quality Framework

## Purpose

The framework is concerned with using "good" software engineering to support rapid and safe delivery of high-quality software, at scale. It aims to:
* Describe a shared (across multiple teams) view of what "good" software delivery and operations looks like
* Assist teams to practice continuous improvement
* Signpost useful training resources and examples/blueprints relating to aspects of "good"
* Provide resources useful for establishment & expansion of an engineering community

## Philosophy

The philosophy underpinning this framework advocates:
* Empowered teams which are accountable for their products: "You build it, you run it" (Werner Vogels)
* Rapid, iterative and incremental development: "Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers." (Eric S. Raymond in [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar))
* Reliable services, remembering "Everything fails, all the time" (Werner Vogels), and treating operations as a software engineering challenge (as in Google's [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/))

## Context

The framework is a companion to the [NHS service standard](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard), and considers software delivery to be a collaborative process across the disciplines in the team, with these areas of specific focus:
* **What** is delivered is the primary focus of Service Design, User Research, and Product
* **How** it is delivered (both the construction and the operation) is the primary focus of Engineering and Delivery

This framework focusses on the "how"

## Contents

The framework consists of:
* [Engineering principles](principles.md)
* [Quality assessment tool](assessment.md)
* [Communities of practice guidelines](communities-of-practice.md) and active communities:
     * [Product Development Automation Working Group](communities/pd-automation-working-group.md)
