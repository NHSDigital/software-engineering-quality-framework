# Quickstart

This page will guide you through how to adopt the Engineering Quality Framework within your team.

## Overview

Read the [introduction](README.md) to the Engineering Framework.

## Dashboard

Complete an [engineering dashboard](insights/metrics.md).
This will quickly assess the engineering maturity of your team in specific areas.

## Review

Complete a [quality review](insights/review.md).
This is a team-led self assessment to discover areas of improvement: a "technical retro".

## Use existing solutions

The [tools section](tools) contains cloneable tools, scripts, docker files, and pipeline steps that can be added straight to your existing systems.

## Embed best practices within your team

The entire team should familiarise themselves with the [Principals](principles.md) set out in the framework. And the common [Patterns](patterns) that help achieve those Principals.

Specialists should familiarise themselves with [best Practices](practices) in their areas.

We recommend running a quality review ever 3 months to reassess.
