This page will guide you through how to adopt the Engineering Quality Framework within your team.

## Overview

Read the [introduction](README.md) to the Engineering Framework.

## Dashboard

Complete an [engineering dashboard](insights/metrics.md).
This will quickly assess the engineering maturity of your team in specific areas.

## Review

Complete a [quality review](insights/review.md).
This is a team-led self assessment to discover areas of improvement: a "technical retro".

## Use existing solutions

Browse the [tools section](tools).
This contains cloneable scripts, docker files, and pipeline steps that can be added straight to your existing systems.

## Embed best practices within your team

The entire team should familiarise themselves with the Framework's [Principles](principles.md).
And with the common [Patterns](patterns) that help achieve those Principles.

Specialists should familiarise themselves with [best Practices](practices) in their areas. Teams building APIs should refer to the [policies and best practice guidance](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-policies-and-best-practice) on building APIs.

Run a quality review every 3 months to keep track of progress.

Update dashboards monthly.
