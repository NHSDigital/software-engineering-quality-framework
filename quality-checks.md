# Engineering quality-checks

This is part of a broader [quality framework](README.md) and forms a key part of the [metrics](insights/metrics.md) section.

## Summary

Quality checks are at the heart of good engineering, and are essential for rapid and safe delivery of software changes. This page provides an index of the various quality checks described within our principles, patterns and practices.

The checks are classified here based on the concerns they help to address:

* Functionality
* Security
* Resilience
* Maintainability

## Usage

All applicable quality checks should be applied. Not all checks are universal, i.e. applicable in all contexts. For example, accessibility testing is only applicable to applications with a user interface.

The majority of these checks should be [automated](./patterns/automate-everything.md) via [continuous integration / continuous deployment](./practices/continuous-integration.md): the optimal sequencing of these checks within CI/CD pipelines will depend on the project's branching strategy, deployment strategy, etc.

All of these checks are important, even where their purpose overlaps with other checks in the list. For example, comprehensive functional testing could be achieved without unit testing, instead only using the other functional test types on this list - this would result in a very long-running and inefficient test suite, precluding fast feedback and impeding rapid and safe delivery of software changes. For further details please see [test practices](./practices/testing.md), and especially the [test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html).

Although we separate resilience checks into their notional components, when it comes to implementation these may be joined up where useful. For example, an automated test suite may test the application for peak load and then drop down to sustained load in order to conduct a soak test.

## RAG scale

We rate our applications against each of these checks as follows:

* Green = the quality check is applied frequently and consistently (in practice this typically means [automated](./patterns/automate-everything.md) via [continuous integration / continuous deployment](./practices/continuous-integration.md)), the output of the check is a quality gate (as opposed to just a warning / for information), and the tolerances for that quality gate (e.g. code coverage %) are agreed and understood.
* Amber = the quality check is applied, but not all conditions for green are met - for example the check generates warnings that may or may not be acted on, or is executed on an ad-hoc basis and cannot offer a consistent quality gate guarantee.
* Red = the quality check is not applied.
* N/A = the quality check is not applicable.

## Tracking progress

We recommend tracking progress on an Engineering Quality dashboard, for example:

## Publishing code

All code should be treated the same and treated well (please see [everything as code](./patterns/everything-as-code.md)), but code that is being published (i.e. made available outside of NHS Digital, for example in a public repository on GitHub) incurs additional considerations.

For example, it's never good to include credentials and other secrets in source code, but the impact of this is obviously greater if the code is made available to the public.

Therefore, for published code, the following minimums are required:

* Unit tests: GREEN
* Integration tests: AMBER (where applicable)
* API / contract tests: AMBER (where applicable)
* UI tests: AMBER (where applicable)
* Secret scanning: AMBER (including removal of any secrets)
* Security code analysis and Security testing: AMBER for at least one of these
* Dependency scanning: AMBER
* Code coverage: AMBER
* Duplicate code scan: AMBER
* Code smells scan: AMBER
* Dead code scan: AMBER
* Code review: GREEN
* Accessibility tests: AMBER (where applicable)
